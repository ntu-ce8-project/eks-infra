# Generate all the diagrams

We use KubeDiagrams to generate our beautiful diagrams.

To generate all the diagrams in the cluster, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the cluster is up and everything is installed.
1. Check and update the namespaces that you want diagrams for.
1. Simply run the script `generate-diagrams.sh` to generate all the diagrams.

```sh
./generate-diagrams.sh
```
